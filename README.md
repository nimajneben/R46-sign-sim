# R46-sign-sim

Some old Arduino files from the depths of my old backups.

This code displays text from elements of an array for three seconds, simulating the side destination signs of the New York City Transit R46 Subway Car.

Which has a one large-display character display for the bullet and a 15-character smaller-size display for the destination text.

The original setup for this has since been taken apart.
The code was programmed for an Adafruit Metro 328 (Arduino Uno compatible), and a standard 16x2 LCD screen, HD44780 chip.
